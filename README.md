# Image Encryption Tool

This project provides a simple image encryption tool that applies basic manipulation techniques to secure image data. It allows users to swap pixels and apply mathematical operations (e.g., adding a constant value to pixel values) to make the images unreadable without proper decryption. 

## Features:
- Pixel swapping for basic encryption.
- Mathematical operations on pixel values for further transformation.
- Option to select, view, and save encrypted images.

## Usage:
1. Run the script.
2. Select an image file using the file dialog.
3. View the original, swapped, and modified (encrypted) images.
4. Save the encrypted images.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `Pillow` library (for image handling)
- `numpy` library (for array manipulation)

## Installation:
```bash
pip install pillow numpy
