# image-encryption-tool
This Image Encryption Tool performs basic image manipulation techniques to secure images. It swaps pixels and applies mathematical operations (e.g., adding a constant value to pixel values) to make images unreadable without decryption. Users can select, view, and save encrypted images for secure storage.
